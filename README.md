# hairutility-iOS


This is the iOS app I worked on from Oct. 2016- Oct.2019. The goal was to help people receive better haircuts. It contains a lot of messy code due to rapid-development and my inexperience when I started developing the app.

All UIViews were created using Swift (without storyboard builder). I did this so that I can have a better understanding of the code with the views.

The app sends request to a Django REST Api at https://www.hairutility.com/.
