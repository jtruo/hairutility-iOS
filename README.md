# hairutility-iOS


This is the iOS app I worked on from Oct. 2016- Sep. 2019. The goal was to help people receive better haircuts. It contains a lot of messy code due to rapid-development and my inexperience when I started developing the app. It ended up being a fun learning experience for me, and I can re-use this code for other passion projects.

All UIViews were created using Swift (without storyboard builder). I did this so that I can have a better understanding of the code with the views. There are about ~7600 lines of code including white space. Half-way through development, I used the MVC pattern. Had the code been modularized and used generics, it could have reduced a few thousands lines of code, due to the size of UIView code.

The app sends requests to a Django REST API to https://www.hairutility.com/.
